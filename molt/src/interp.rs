//! The Molt Interpreter
//!
//! The [`Interp`] struct is the primary API for embedding Molt into a Rust application.
//! Given an `Interp`, the application may:
//!
//! * Evaluate scripts and expressions
//! * Check scripts for completeness
//! * Extend the language by defining new Molt commands in Rust
//! * Set and get Molt variables
//! * Access application data via the context cache
//!
//! The following describes the features of the [`Interp`] in general; follow the links for
//! specifics of the various types and methods. See also [The Molt Book] for a general
//! introduction to Molt and its API.
//!
//! # Interp is not Sync!
//!
//! The [`Interp`] class (and the rest of Molt) is intended for use in a single thread.  It is
//! safe to have `Interps` in different threads; but use `String` (or another `Sync`)
//! when passing data between them.  In particular, [`Value`] is not `Sync`.
//!
//! # Creating an Interpreter
//!
//! There are two ways to create an interpreter.  The usual way is to call
//! [`Interp::new`](struct.Interp.html#method.new), which creates an interpreter and populates
//! it with all of the standard Molt commands.  The application can then add any
//! application-specific commands.
//!
//! Alternatively, [`Interp::empty`](struct.Interp.html#method.empty) creates an interpreter
//! with no built-in commands, allowing the application to define only those commands it needs.
//! Such an empty interpreter can be configured as the parser for data and configuration files,
//! or as the basis for a simple, non-scriptable console command set.
//!
//! **TODO**: Define a way to add various subsets of the standard commands to an initially
//! empty interpreter.
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! let mut interp = Interp::new();
//!
//! // add commands, evaluate scripts, etc.
//! ```
//!
//! # Evaluating Scripts
//!
//! There are a number of ways to evaluate Molt scripts.  The simplest is to pass the script
//! as a string to `Interp::eval`.  The interpreter evaluates the string as a Molt script, and
//! returns either a normal [`Value`] containing the result, or a Molt error. The script is
//! evaluated in the caller's context: if called at the application level, the script will be
//! evaluated in the interpreter's global scope; if called by a Molt command, it will be
//! evaluated in the scope in which that command is executing.
//!
//! For example, the following snippet uses the Molt `expr` command to evaluate an expression.
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! use molt::molt_ok;
//! use molt::types::*;
//!
//! # let _ = dummy();
//! # fn dummy() -> MoltResult {
//! // FIRST, create the interpreter and add the needed command.
//! let mut interp = Interp::new();
//!
//! // NEXT, evaluate a script containing an expression
//! let val = interp.eval("expr {2 + 2}")?;
//! assert_eq!(val.as_str(), "4");
//! assert_eq!(val.as_int()?, 4);
//! # molt_ok!()
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Interp::eval_value`](struct.Interp.html#method.eval_value) evaluates the string
//! representation of a `Value` as a script.
//! [`Interp::eval_body`](struct.Interp.html#method.eval_body) is used to evaluate the body
//! of loops and other control structures.  Unlike `Interp::eval` and `Interp::eval_value`, it
//! passes the `return`, `break`, and `continue` result codes back to the caller for handling.
//!
//! All of these methods return [`MoltResult`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub type MoltResult = Result<Value, ResultCode>;
//! ```
//!
//! [`Value`] is the type of all Molt values (i.e., values that can be passed as parameters and
//! stored in variables).  [`ResultCode`] is an enum that encompasses all of the kinds of
//! exceptional return from Molt code, including errors, `return`, `break`, and `continue`.
//!
//! # Evaluating Expressions
//!
//! In Molt, as in Standard Tcl, algebraic expressions are evaluated by the `expr` command.  At
//! the Rust level this feature is provided by the
//! [`Interp::expr`](struct.Interp.html#method.expr) method, which takes the expression as a
//! [`Value`] and returns the computed `Value` or an error.
//!
//! There are three convenience methods,
//! [`Interp::expr_bool`](struct.Interp.html#method.expr_bool),
//! [`Interp::expr_int`](struct.Interp.html#method.expr_int), and
//! [`Interp::expr_float`](struct.Interp.html#method.expr_float), which streamline the computation
//! of a particular kind of value, and return an error if the computed result is not of that type.
//!
//! For example, the following code shows how a command can evaluate a string as a boolean value,
//! as in the `if` or `while` commands:
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! use molt::molt_ok;
//! use molt::types::*;
//!
//! # let _ = dummy();
//! # fn dummy() -> MoltResult {
//! // FIRST, create the interpreter
//! let mut interp = Interp::new();
//!
//! // NEXT, get an expression as a Value.  In a command body it would
//! // usually be passed in as a Value.
//! let expr = Value::from("1 < 2");
//!
//! // NEXT, evaluate it!
//! assert!(interp.expr_bool(&expr)?);
//! # molt_ok!()
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! These methods will return an error if the string cannot be interpreted
//! as an expression of the relevant type.
//!
//! # Defining New Commands
//!
//! The usual reason for embedding Molt in an application is to extend it with
//! application-specific commands.  There are several ways to do this.
//!
//! The simplest method, and the one used by most of Molt's built-in commands, is to define a
//! [`CommandFunc`] and register it with the interpreter using the
//! [`Interp::add_command`](struct.Interp.html#method.add_command) method. A `CommandFunc` is
//! simply a Rust function that returns a [`MoltResult`] given an interpreter and a slice of Molt
//! [`Value`] objects representing the command name and its arguments. The function may interpret
//! the array of arguments in any way it likes.
//!
//! The following example defines a command called `square` that squares an integer value.
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! use molt::check_args;
//! use molt::molt_ok;
//! use molt::types::*;
//!
//! # let _ = dummy();
//! # fn dummy() -> MoltResult {
//! // FIRST, create the interpreter and add the needed command.
//! let mut interp = Interp::new();
//! interp.add_command("square", cmd_square);
//!
//! // NEXT, try using the new command.
//! let val = interp.eval("square 5")?;
//! assert_eq!(val.as_str(), "25");
//! # molt_ok!()
//! # }
//!
//! // The command: square intValue
//! fn cmd_square(_: &mut Interp, _: ContextID, argv: &[Value]) -> MoltResult {
//!     // FIRST, check the number of arguments.  Returns an appropriate error
//!     // for the wrong number of arguments.
//!     check_args(1, argv, 2, 2, "intValue")?;
//!
//!     // NEXT, get the intValue argument as an int.  Returns an appropriate error
//!     // if the argument can't be interpreted as an integer.
//!     let intValue = argv[1].as_int()?;
//!
//!     // NEXT, return the product.
//!     molt_ok!(intValue * intValue)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The new command can then be used in a Molt interpreter:
//!
//! ```tcl
//! % square 5
//! 25
//! % set a [square 6]
//! 36
//! % puts "a=$a"
//! a=36
//! ```
//!
//! # Accessing Variables
//!
//! Molt defines two kinds of variables, scalars and arrays.  A scalar variable is a named holder
//! for a [`Value`].  An array variable is a named hash table whose elements are named holders
//! for `Values`.  Each element in an array is like a scalar in its own right.  In Molt code
//! the two kinds of variables are accessed as follows:
//!
//! ```tcl
//! % set myScalar 1
//! 1
//! % set myArray(myElem) 2
//! 2
//! % puts "$myScalar $myArray(myElem)"
//! 1 2
//! ```
//!
//! In theory, any string can be a valid variable or array index string.  In practice, variable
//! names usually follow the normal rules for identifiers: letters, digits and underscores,
//! beginning with a letter, while array index strings usually don't contain parentheses and
//! so forth.  But array index strings can be arbitrarily complex, and so a single TCL array can
//! contain a vast variety of data structures.
//!
//! Molt commands will usually use the
//! [`Interp::var`](struct.Interp.html#method.var),
//! [`Interp::set_var`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_var), and
//! [`Interp::set_var_return`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_var_return) methods to set and
//! retrieve variables.  Each takes a variable reference as a `Value`.  `Interp::var` retrieves
//! the variable's value as a `Value`, return an error if the variable doesn't exist.
//! `Interp::set_var` and `Interp::set_var_return` set the variable's value, creating the
//! variable or array element if it doesn't exist.
//!
//! `Interp::set_var_return` returns the value assigned to the variable, which is convenient
//! for commands that return the value assigned to the variable.  The standard `set` command,
//! for example, returns the assigned or retrieved value; it is defined like this:
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! use molt::check_args;
//! use molt::molt_ok;
//! use molt::types::*;
//!
//! pub fn cmd_set(interp: &mut Interp, _: ContextID, argv: &[Value]) -> MoltResult {
//!    check_args(1, argv, 2, 3, "varName ?newValue?")?;
//!
//!    if argv.len() == 3 {
//!        interp.set_var_return(&argv[1], argv[2].clone())
//!    } else {
//!        molt_ok!(interp.var(&argv[1])?)
//!    }
//!}
//! ```
//!
//! At times it can be convenient to explicitly access a scalar variable or array element by
//! by name.  The methods
//! [`Interp::scalar`](struct.Interp.html#method.scalar),
//! [`Interp::set_scalar`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_scalar),
//! [`Interp::set_scalar_return`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_scalar_return),
//! [`Interp::element`](struct.Interp.html#method.element),
//! [`Interp::set_element`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_element), and
//! [`Interp::set_element_return`](struct.Interp.html#method.set_element_return)
//! provide this access.
//!
//! # Managing Application or Library-Specific Data
//!
//! Molt provides a number of data types out of the box: strings, numbers, and lists.  However,
//! any data type that can be unambiguously converted to and from a string can be easily
//! integrated into Molt. See the [`value`] module for details.
//!
//! Other data types _cannot_ be represented as strings in this way, e.g., file handles,
//! database handles, or keys into complex application data structures.  Such types can be
//! represented as _key strings_ or as _object commands_.  In Standard TCL/TK, for example,
//! open files are represented as strings like `file1`, `file2`, etc.  The commands for
//! reading and writing to files know how to look these keys up in the relevant data structure.
//! TK widgets, on the other hand, are presented as object commands: a command with subcommands
//! where the command itself knows how to access the relevant data structure.
//!
//! Application-specific commands often need access to the application's data structure.
//! Often many commands will need access to the same data structure.  This is often the case
//! for complex binary extensions as well (families of Molt commands implemented as a reusable
//! crate), where all of the commands in the extension need access to some body of
//! extension-specific data.
//!
//! All of these patterns (and others) are implemented by means of the interpreter's
//! _context cache_, which is a means of relating mutable data to a particular command or
//! family of commands.  See below.
//!
//! # Commands and the Context Cache
//!
//! Most Molt commands require access only to the Molt interpreter in order to do their
//! work.  Some need mutable or immutable access to command-specific data (which is often
//! application-specific data).  This is provided by means of the interpreter's
//! _context cache_:
//!
//! * The interpreter is asked for a new `ContextID`, an ID that is unique in that interpreter.
//!
//! * The client associates the context ID with a new instance of a context data structure,
//!   usually a struct.  This data structure is added to the context cache.
//!
//!   * This struct may contain the data required by the command(s), or keys allowing it
//!     to access the data elsewhere.
//!
//! * The `ContextID` is provided to the interpreter when adding commands that require that
//!   context.
//!
//! * A command can mutably access its context data when it is executed.
//!
//! * The cached data is dropped when the last command referencing a `ContextID` is removed
//!   from the interpreter.
//!
//! This mechanism supports all of the patterns described above.  For example, Molt's
//! test harness provides a `test` command that defines a single test.  When it executes, it must
//! increment a number of statistics: the total number of tests, the number of successes, the
//! number of failures, etc.  This can be implemented as follows:
//!
//! ```
//! use molt::Interp;
//! use molt::check_args;
//! use molt::molt_ok;
//! use molt::types::*;
//!
//! // The context structure to hold the stats
//! struct Stats {
//!     num_tests: usize,
//!     num_passed: usize,
//!     num_failed: usize,
//! }
//!
//! // Whatever methods the app needs
//! impl Stats {
//!     fn new() -> Self {
//!         Self { num_tests: 0, num_passed: 0, num_failed: 0}
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # let _ = dummy();
//! # fn dummy() -> MoltResult {
//! // Create the interpreter.
//! let mut interp = Interp::new();
//!
//! // Create the context struct, assigning a context ID
//! let context_id = interp.save_context(Stats::new());
//!
//! // Add the `test` command with the given context.
//! interp.add_context_command("test", cmd_test, context_id);
//!
//! // Try using the new command.  It should increment the `num_passed` statistic.
//! let val = interp.eval("test ...")?;
//! assert_eq!(interp.context::<Stats>(context_id).num_passed, 1);
//! # molt_ok!()
//! # }
//!
//! // A stub test command.  It ignores its arguments, and
//! // increments the `num_passed` statistic in its context.
//! fn cmd_test(interp: &mut Interp, context_id: ContextID, argv: &[Value]) -> MoltResult {
//!     // Pretend it passed
//!     interp.context::<Stats>(context_id).num_passed += 1;
//!
//!     molt_ok!()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Ensemble Commands
//!
//! An _ensemble command_ is simply a command with subcommands, like the standard Molt `info`
//! and `array` commands.  At the Rust level, it is simply a command that looks up its subcommand
//! (e.g., `argv[1]`) in an array of `Subcommand` structs and executes it as a command.
//!
//! The [`Interp::call_subcommand`](struct.Interp.html#method.call_subcommand) method is used
//! to look up and call the relevant command function, handling all relevant errors in the
//! TCL-standard way.
//!
//! For example, the `array` command is defined as follows.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! const ARRAY_SUBCOMMANDS: [Subcommand; 6] = [
//!     Subcommand("exists", cmd_array_exists),
//!     Subcommand("get", cmd_array_get),
//!     // ...
//! ];
//!
//! pub fn cmd_array(interp: &mut Interp, context_id: ContextID, argv: &[Value]) -> MoltResult {
//!     interp.call_subcommand(context_id, argv, 1, &ARRAY_SUBCOMMANDS)
//! }
//!
//! pub fn cmd_array_exists(interp: &mut Interp, _: ContextID, argv: &[Value]) -> MoltResult {
//!     check_args(2, argv, 3, 3, "arrayName")?;
//!     molt_ok!(Value::from(interp.array_exists(argv[2].as_str())))
//! }
//!
//! // ...
//! ```
//!
//! The `cmd_array` and `cmd_array_exists` functions are just normal Molt `CommandFunc`
//! functions.  The `array` command is added to the interpreter using `Interp::add_command`
//! in the usual way. Note that the `context_id` is passed to the subcommand functions, though
//! in this case it isn't needed.
//!
//! Also, notice that the call to `check_args` in `cmd_array_exists` has `2` as its first
//! argument, rather than `1`.  That indicates that the first two arguments represent the
//! command being called, e.g., `array exists`.
//!
//! # Object Commands
//!
//! An _object command_ is an _ensemble command_ that represents an object; the classic TCL
//! examples are the TK widgets.  The pattern for defining object commands is as follows:
//!
//! * A constructor command that creates instances of the given object type.  (We use the word
//!   *type* rather than *class* because inheritance is usually neither involved or available.)
//!
//! * An instance is an ensemble command:
//!   * Whose name is provided to the constructor
//!   * That has an associated context structure, initialized by the constructor, that belongs
//!     to it alone.
//!
//! * Each of the object's subcommand functions is passed the object's context ID, so that all
//!   can access the object's data.
//!
//! Thus, the constructor command will do the following:
//!
//! * Create and initialize a context structure, assigning it a `ContextID` via
//!   `Interp::save_context`.
//!   * The context structure may be initialized with default values, or configured further
//!     based on the constructor command's arguments.
//!
//! * Determine a name for the new instance.
//!   * The name is usually passed in as an argument, but can be computed.
//!
//! * Create the instance using `Interp::add_context_command` and the instance's ensemble
//!   `CommandFunc`.
//!
//! * Usually, return the name of the newly created command.
//!
//! Note that there's no real difference between defining a simple ensemble like `array`, as
//! shown above, and defining an object command as described here, except that:
//!
//! * The instance is usually created "on the fly" rather than at interpreter initialization.
//! * The instance will always have data in the context cache.
//!
//! # Checking Scripts for Completeness
//!
//! The [`Interp::complete`](struct.Interp.html#method.complete) method checks whether a Molt
//! script is complete: e.g., that it contains no unterminated quoted or braced strings,
//! that would prevent it from being evaluated as Molt code.  This is useful when
//! implementing a Read-Eval-Print-Loop, as it allows the REPL to easily determine whether it
//! should evaluate the input immediately or ask for an additional line of input.
